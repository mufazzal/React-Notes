eval():-
	This is one of the most controversial function, it evaluate the string as javascript but it is not at all recomendded to use
	Why 
	Suppose you have a input box and eval it value like
		eval($('input')[0].value)
	Because user now can pass malocious code in it and do hacking.
	The only place where eval is very useful->
		creating a javascript online editor like jsfiddle etc.
	In old days eval was used to convert string to json, but ES6 have its own JSON class.
