let and const:-
	let and const both are from ES6, so they are processed and consumed at conpile time only, 
	any error in there use also detected at compile time at by the 'babel-loader'.
	So if you write the following code in imported JS: 
		let x = 9098789;
		const xed = 78945651;	
	Now if you go into bundle.js (after succesful compilation by 'babel-loader') it will be converted to : 
		var x = 9098789;
		var xed = 78945651;	

	let:-
		let is substitute of 'var' when we need scope of variable only in some 'if/for' block.
		If you use let instead of 'var' the scope will confined into the enclosing 'if/for' block;
			function fun() {
				for(..)/if(true/false) { let x = 5;}
				console.log(x)						//red 'error' in console [but if u would have used 'var' than it will give undefined/5 in the console]
			}
		let in for loop bracket not body :-

			function fun() {
				for(let i = 0; i < 4; i++) { .. }
				console.log(i)						//red 'error' in console 
			}		
		So in for loop if we declare in indexer (i) with var than it will have scope outside too, but if we declare with 'let' it will have scope inside only.

		scope of var leak outside (before and after) of if/for block  but not out of function block
		scope of let leak not of any enclosing block.
		
	const: 
		No need to explain. all thing of let apply to const too excect that in cannot be re-assign.
		Is there any way to make const in Es5 ? 
		Yes! you can use 'Object.defineProperty(..)' and keep 'writable' param false. though it must be lies in some context (mns object 'obj' will wrap him)
			Object.defineProperty(obj, 'pi', {value: '3.14', wriatable: false, ....})

	Hoisting:-
		let and const both support hoisting so 
			console.log(x1)	
			const/let x1 = 90;
		will not give red error.
		But
			console.log(x1)	
			x1 = 90;
		will give red error

lambda fnction: 
	To make the function tiny this is invented: 
	thoug after the compilation this function is converted into the normal js function '=>' is completey consumed and removed in 'bundle.js'
	EG:
		1.	normal lemda function
				var lftyp = (name, city) => { ... return <...> };	
		2.	lemda function with only one param
				var lftyp = name => { ... return <...> };			
		3.	lemda function single line body 
				var lftyp = (name, city) =>  name + ' -- ' + city;				// return the formatted string.					
				var lftyp = (name, city) =>  c.l(name + ' -- ' + city);			// return undefined
		4.	lemda function single line body  + 	only one param
				var lftyp = name =>  'name : ' + name;
		5.	lemda function with no param
				var ff = () => ....

	lembda function and 'this.' [the lexical this]:-		
		'this.' in the lembda function always and always point to whatever the 'this.' of parent function is pointing.
		NOW THE MOST IMP POINT TO REMEMBER:  YOU CANNOT BIND THE 'lambda' FUNCTION, so that 'this.' can not be chagerd at all.
		if the parent function hase this=undefined, then its lenda function is alsp give 'this.' undefined, no matter you bind it with something else.
		At a time of declaration of lemda function, it is binded with context of parents function context by internal framwork

			context of arrow function === context of its parent function.
			
			var obj = {name: 'hus'}	
			function Home() { 		OR 		calss Home
				this.name = 'muf'
				var inffEs5 = function()  	{ console.log('inffEs5', this.name); }
				var inffEs6 = 				() => { console.log('inffEs6', this.name); }
				
				inffEs5();				//error
				inffEs6();				//muf

				inffEs5.bind(obj)();	//hus
				inffEs6.bind(obj)();	//muf		//BINDING make no effect in it in any way
			}
			var home = new Home();
	
	
	
	lambda function can not be used as
		1. member function of an object:-
				You cannot use it as menber of a object, this in that case will reprsent the parent context not the object itself.
				the parent contxt coult be anything else, it could be window or undefined.
				const obj = {
					x: 'df',
					normalFun: function () 		{ console.log(this) },
					lambdaFun: 					() => { console.log(this) }
				}
				obj.outLambdFun = () => { console.log(this) }
				
				obj.lambdaFun()		--> this will be undefined
				obj.normalFun()		--> this will the obj.
				obj.outLambdFun()	--> this will be undefined
			
			Even bind will not work here for lambda function
			const bindedLambdFun = obj.lambdaFun.bind(this)
			bindedLambdFun() 	--> this will be undefined, because lambda cannot be binded
			
		
---------------------------------------

Map and Set:-
		A very new thing in ES6 is addition of Set and Map, this is very simmilar to one in Java, but its use is very limited bcoz of strong functionality of Object 
		itself.
	Set:-
		var idSet = new Set(['12', '23', '23', '45', 45]);
		out- ['12', '23', '45', 45]
		So set dicriminate between numeric-string and string
		Most useful function:-
			size()
			has()
			clear()
			delete()
		iterate: 
			You can itrate it with 
				for (let item of idSet) console.log(item);
		Set to Array:
			let arr = [...idSet];
		Array to Set: 
			new Set(arr);
		
	Map:-
		this is also same as in java to create a map pass a two dimention array:-
		var m = new Map([
				[ 1, 'one' ],
				[ 2, 'two' ],
				[ 3, 'thr' ]
			])
		imp fun:-
			has()
			delete()
			clear()
			size()
		iterate:-
		best way-
			for (let [key, value] of  m.entries()) console.log(key, value);
			also you can use m.keys() or m.values()
		map to array of key/value/kv-pair :
			let arr = [...m.keys()/m.values()/m.enteries()];
		
-------------------------------------		
		
	There are some more thing left to study the ES6: read futher topic after 'Map and Set' from link 
	https://www.tutorialspoint.com/es6/es6_collections.htm

-------------------------------------

varax/spreead operator: ...
	Uses
		1.	this operator can be used to send formal param in function without knowing the count 
					myFun(p, d, ...vx) { ...vx[0]....}
		2.	merging in the array
					[2, 5, ...vx]
		3.	nodelist to array:
					[...document.querySelectorAll('div')]
		4.	array destructuring: 
					let [ x, y, ...a] = [  1,  2,  3,  4 ];
					a-> [1, 2]		
		5.	array concat:
					[...ar1, t, y, ..ar2, ...ar3, ]
			
	This is very useful to creat a shallow copy of objevt: 
		var vv = {name: 'muf', add: {line1: '13 bohra'} }
		var cvv = {...vv}
		Now cvv is shallow copy of vv.
		For deep copy :
		 cvv = {...vv, add: {...vv.add}}
			
	also see "#REFREST_PARAM" in js.txt
--------------------
Destructuring:-
	Object:-
		
	Array:-
		const myarray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
		const [y, z] = myarray;						y=1, z=2
		const [y, z, ...r] = myarray;			y=1, z=2, r = [3, 4, 5]
	Object:-
		For object de-structuring you must know the key name.
		const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4};				
		const { a, b } = obj;							a=1, b=2
		const { a, b, ...r} = obj;				a=1, b=2, r={c: 3, d: 4}
		
		Changing key name:-
				const { a: a1, b: b1, ...r} = obj;											a1=1, b1=2, r={c: 3, d: 4}
		setting dfault value
				const { a: a1 = defa, b: b1 = defb, ...r} = obj;				a1=1, b1=2, r={c: 3, d: 4}

--------------------
String template/interpolation:
	Another beautiful feature is string interpolation.
	in es5: 
		var str = 'Count: ' + item.count + 'price:' + item.price + ' total: - ' + (item.count * item.price)
	in es6:
		var str = `count ${item.count} | price ${item.price} Total: ${item.count * item.price} `
		Out>> count 5 | price 50 Total: 250
		
	This work only with `
	it will not work with ' or "
	if you use ' or " in the string wrapped by ` then it will be considered as simple string
		so 
		`"count": ${item.count} ` >> "count" : 5
	
---------------------

Quick property assignment :
		var x = 0, y = 0
		obj = { x, y }		//{x: 0, y: 0}
	in ES5:
		var x = 0, y = 0
		obj = { x: x, y: y }		//{x: 0, y: 0}

---------------------
Advance litral assignment:
	let obj = {
		name: "muf",
		[ "his " + getAgeString() ]: 42
	}
	in ES5:
		obj[ "his " + getAgeString() ]: 42
		
-----------------
Object mapping : 
		var { name, add, comp, greet } = getASTNode()
		function getASTNode() { return {greet: 'Hello', name: 'muf', add1: 'bar', comp: {name: 'acc', loc: 'pune'}} }
		console.log( name, add, comp, greet);
		OUT:
		muf, undefined, {name: "acc", loc: "pune"}, Hello
		
			Mapping is done with key in LHS and key in RHS, not with the positions.
			That is why 'add' remain null bcoz same key does not find at RHS.
			'add1' remain unassigned to anything bcoz same key does not find at LHS.
			value of 'greet' is assigned properly even though they have positions mismatch

			Basically from the RHS multiple value return each with a name assosiated with it.
			At LHS those values assign to matching name.

	Deep Mapping:
		var {comp: {name, loc}} = getComp();
		getComp() {return {comp: {name: 'acc', loc: 'pune'}} }
		name-> 'acc'
		loc-> 'pune'
		comp-> undefined
		
			For deep mapping yoou have to strcture the correct mapping structure ate LHS and RHS.
			values at the right will be maped to values at the left, keys will only be used to map them.

			at LHS 'comp:' is key to map, name and loc is actual variable to map at 
			
			anothe eg:
				var {comp: {name: nn, loc: ll}} = getComp();
				getComp() {return {comp: {name: 'acc', loc: 'pune'}} }
				name-> undefined
				loc-> undefined
				nn-> 'acc'
				ll-> 'pune'
				comp-> undefined
	
Mapping array:-
	This is solely done by positioning and it does not support deep de-structuring
		var [ara, arb, comp] = [1, 2, {name: 'muf', comp: {name: 'acc'}}];
		console.log(ara, arb, comp);	
		OUT >> 1 2 {name: "muf", comp: {â€¦}}
------------------------------

generator function : 
	Unlike traditional function, which called, execute and return after that.
	in generator function you can do multiple return in sigle call. this sunction maintain its state and yield.
	usage:-
		   function * fun()
			{
				yield 10;
				yield 20;
				return 30
				yield 40;    
			}			  
			var gen = fun();
			console.log(gen.next());		{value: "10", done: false}
			console.log(gen.next());		{value: "20", done: false}
			console.log(gen.next());		{value: "30", done: true}
			console.log(gen.next());		{done: true}
	
		- to make a next iteration call use next()
			The result of next() is always an object with two properties:
				value: the yielded value.
				done: true if the function code has finished, otherwise false
		- to do manual return you can call 'gen.return()'. after that all next() call will yield undefined.
	
	what if you do return in it:-
	????

spread oprator somtime give issue in compiling.
create .babelrc file and put "plugins": ["transform-object-rest-spread"]   in it
