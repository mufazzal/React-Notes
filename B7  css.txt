CSS prepossessor -

writing css may be very tedious if you do it in plane manner.
But some of the preprocesser make it a candy. here you can write the css in very simple and understandable way.
But in the end you need to convert it to .css file so that browser can understand.

This is like ES6 or typesriipt of JS. we write the code in it but in the end convert it to plain js so that browser can understand it.

Two most common css preprocesser are 
1.	LESS
2.	SAAS

LESS:-
	If you wants to know how in simplify the css writing go to 'http://lesscss.org/#overview'
	We will see how in the end we will convert it to '*.css' from '.less'

for this 
npm install less.

then run the commande 'bin/lessc' in node enviorment.

> cd path/to/node_module/less/bin
> node lessc path/to/file.less output.css

after running  this commande the less code will be converted to css.
