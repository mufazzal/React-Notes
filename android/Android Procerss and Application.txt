Each android app is a process itself and this can be in one of 5 phase.

1. 	Froground Process: 
	a.	frorground activity
	b.	services which are bound to frorground activity only
	c.	all forground services. startForrgroundService()
	d.	in any callback function
2.	Visible process
	a.	Visible activity
	b.	services which are bound to Visible activity only
3.	Service process
	a.	services started with startService()
4.	Background process:
	a.	Background/Stopped activities (use savedInstance to recreate) [multiple such process resolved by LRU algo]
5.	Empty process
	a.	all cached process which are hold for quick relaunch if required
