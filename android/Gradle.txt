Gradle simplly combine all your code, resorce, libs and generate apk.
It passes from diffrent phse as below



To set perameter while building the apk u have to use configuration file which is 'build.gradle'
There are more than one such file exists in the project.
But to configure build process you have to deal wiyh only one such file wich lies at 
module leval (Which is also calle  'app Module')
in side bar:: 
Project View >> project name >> app >> build.gradle
Android View >> Gradle Script >> build.gradle (Module:app)

open this file

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'  >> 
	declare to take android specific build process for compliling.

android {...}
	insode defines all android specific build options.

compileSdkVersion: 19
	specifies the compilation target.
buildToolsVersion: 19.0.1
	specifies what version of the SDK build tools to use. 
	NOTE: That version of build tool has to bee installed in the android studio. and remember 'SDK build tool' is tottaly 
	diffrent from 'SDK platform'. Never confuse among them.
			And
		buildToolsVersion always must be higher or equal to compileSdkVersion
		otherwise it wont compile  
			buildToolsVersion >= compileSdkVersion
		To install it: open SDK >> Tool >> Android SDK Build Tool   <Version>


defaultConfig: this configures core settings and entries in the manifest file 	(AndroidManifest.xml) dynamically from the build system. The values in 	defaultConfig override those in the manifest file.
	it has a heigher priority than AndroidManifest.xml.
	


DEpendencies {..}:
This defines all type of dependencies requires ti build the project either remote or local.

In Android we have mainly three type of dependencies, Lets compare it by eclipse
1.	Module Dependency : Library Project : add library project in eclipse
		compile project(":lib") 
2.	Local binary Dependency : : Library .Jar files : Place it in lib folder than right 		click on it and add to build path
		compile files('libs/guava-r09.jar')
3.	Remote Binary Dependency: Remote library is some special type of binary java which 		are installed 	at 'Android SDK' itself and lies at /sdk/extras/android/<lib name>
	This are PLATFORM INDEPEDENT and its version coordinated with some maven bla bla.
		compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.0'
		




Note: When you make changes to the build files in your project, Android Studio requires a project sync to import the build configuration changes. Click Sync Now on the yellow notification bar that appears for Android Studio to import the changes.
