Intent -

An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intent Structure

The primary pieces of information in an intent are:

    action -- The general action to be performed, such as ACTION_VIEW, ACTION_EDIT, ACTION_MAIN, etc.

    data -- The data to operate on, such as a person record in the contacts database, expressed as a Uri.


In addition to these primary attributes, there are a number of secondary attributes that you can also include with an intent:

    category 	-- Gives additional information about the action to execute. 
				For example, CATEGORY_LAUNCHER means it should appear in the Launcher as a top-level application, 
				while CATEGORY_ALTERNATIVE means it should be included in a list of alternative actions the user can perform on a piece of data.

    type 		-- Specifies an explicit type (a MIME type) of the intent data. Normally the type is inferred from the data itself. 
				By setting this attribute, you disable that evaluation and force an explicit type.

    component 	-- Specifies an explicit name of a component class to use for the intent. Normally this is determined by looking 
				at the other information in the intent (the action, data/type, and categories) and
				matching that with a component that can handle it. If this attribute is set then none of the evaluation is performed,
				and this component is used exactly as is. By specifying this attribute, all of the other Intent attributes become optional.

    extras 		-- This is a Bundle of any additional information. This can be used to provide extended information to the component. 
				For example, if we have a action to send an e-mail message, we could also include extra 
				pieces of data here to supply a subject, body, etc.

Intent Resolution

There are two primary forms of intents you will use.

    Explicit Intents : 	have specified a component (via setComponent(ComponentName) or setClass(Context, Class)),
						which provides the exact class to be run. Often these will not include any other information, 
						simply being a way for an application to launch various internal activities it has as the user interacts with the application.

    Implicit Intents :	have not specified a component; instead, they must include enough information for the system 
						to determine which of the available components is best to run for that intent.

Bundle

	U can add any primitive 
	Single :
		Ucan add simpaly
	Array : 
		array of any primitive can be add simpaly
	Arraylist
		only Arraylist of Integer (not int) is allowed can be ad simpaly

	String:
		All three (Single, Array, Arraylist) of string allowed
	
	any Parclable object:
		All three (Single, Array, Arraylist) of Parclable allowed

PendingIntent:	
	whenever u wants to invoke a component A/S/B/C, u build a intent and fire it.
	But how could you schedule it for later
	I mean suppose you dont wants to fire this intent right now but later some time when some action occure on somwhere in the device or time elapse.
	To do this we use pending intent	
	It enable us to invoke a component on some action in the device ocue 
	EX:
	When user click on notiication, With pendingintent we can set the action to play
	same or alarammanager
	Code:
	use below static methodes
		PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getActivity()
		PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getService()
		PendingIntent pi = PendingIntent.getBroadcast()
	now use this pi t te notification or any other API to set this action
