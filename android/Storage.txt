Storage


SharedPreferences: this is simple class that contain key-value pair enteries.
u can create many sharedprefrence file with diffrent name and store key-value pair in it.
for each SharedPreferences file in app a single object of SharedPrefrence is return by  getSharedPrefrence() or getPrefrence() so change at onne instance will reflect at other instance of that SharedPreference.
jst assume that SharedPreferences have such static map in it
	HashMap<String, SharedPreferences>  sMap;
	getSharedPrefrence(st, md) {retturn sMap.get(st);}
	
	
	sp file loc == /data/data/com.package.name/shared_prefs/com.package.name ;
CONTEXT.getDefaultSharedPrefrence() vs CONTEXT.getSharedPrefrence(st,md) vs  ACTIVITY.getPrefrence() :
1.	first one return default sp file which will be accesible to any part of app with any context.
		loc = loc + "_prefrence"
2.	second one will give simple sp of that name file which will be accesible to any part of app with any context.
		loc = loc + "_prefrence" + st;
3.	third  one will give u default sp file for activity and it is  private to activity so cant be used with other component.
	inside it simply call  CONTEXT.getSharedPrefrence(st, md) with   st =  class name of that activity.
		loc = loc + class name of that activity;
 SharedPrefrnceChangeListener :  Use this interface to listen for any changes in SharedPrefrnce.
 
 MODES: 
 1.	_PRIVATE : only accsseble inside app 
 2. _WORLD_READABLE : + can be read outside app
 3. _WORLD_WRITABLE : + can be write outside app
 
 access outside app : 
	provider app: jst creat sp file with mode == MODE_WORLD_READEBE/_WRITABLE; getSharedPrefrence("sharefile",MODE_WORLD_READEBE/_WRITABLE )
	client app:	  pctx = CONTEXT.creatPackageContext("provide app package name");
				  sp = pctx.getSharedPrefrence("sharefile",MODE_WORLD_READEBE/_WRITABLE);
 
 WRite array, arraylist or class object:
 	it does not provide any support for this
	u can use serilize deserlize for them to store it in string formate
	u can use GSON to store as json.
	it does not support PARCLABLE
